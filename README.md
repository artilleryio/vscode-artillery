### Inline test runs

Open any Artillery test script and click the "â–¶ Run load test" link at the top of the file to run that script in Visual Studio Code. This will spawn a new terminal and run the current test script using Artillery CLI.

## Configuration

### `testMatch: Array<string>`

- Default: `**/*.yml`

A list of glob pattern to treat as Artillery test scripts.

For example, you can configure this extension to only treat `*.yml` files in a specific directory as test scripts:

```json
{
  "vscode-artillery.testMatch": "./test/*.yml"
}
```
